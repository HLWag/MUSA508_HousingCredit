This analysis uses a binary logistic regression to estimate whether eligible homeowners are likely to take a home repair tax credit based on a number of features (e.g., age, education level, marital status, unemployment rate). our goal is to create a model that can accurately predict instances of when a homeowner will and will not take the credit.
